        Give each Morpholoy segmnt its independence in UI and state
        Fix the Reset Morph functionalities(future)
        outline seleted words for morphology,
        color of merged words, 
 
        Every word needs to have a unique identifier
        as long as the input is empty in the morph, disable all the selects and fields
        token takes unique identifier as a prop
        token must have a state variable called key
        the tokens data must have a unique context storing its data and active word
        the token had a useEffect that has activeWord as its dependancy array
        everytime the active word changes it go to state of data and it checks if id exists, if it does fetch the data in their perspective field, if not create one
